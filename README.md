# Visual HTML Semantic Tag Explorer – Learn by Building

This project is where I visually explored and experimented with **semantic HTML tags**.  
Instead of reading about them, I wanted to actually *see* them in action — styled, structured, and used in meaningful layouts.

Each file in this repo is a separate version where I tweak and refine how elements like `<article>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, `<aside>`, and more are used. It's part learning tool, part creative experiment.


### 🧠 Why I Built This

- To **understand semantic tags by doing** — not just reading docs  
- To get a feel for how content structure affects accessibility and SEO  
- To train myself to write cleaner, more organized HTML  
- And honestly? Just to practice building cool layouts the right way

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML** – focus on semantic structure  
- **CSS** – clean styling and visual hierarchy  
- **JavaScript** – used in later versions to add minor interactivity

This is one of those projects that helped me *think like a developer* while still designing like a front-end builder.  
Thanks for checking it out!
